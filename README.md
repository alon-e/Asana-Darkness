## WARNING :)
I created this theme with a severe lack of understanding of most CSS, but I hacked at it long enough to where it's usable for how I personally use Asana, so...

If you like it, cool! Feel free to use it and or make it way better, but you're probably better off using the default Asana CSS, because this code has been clumsily cobbled together.

It works for me, though!
